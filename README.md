# Snacks snippets for Raycast

On my website, I have a dev recipe section called [snacks](https://hamatti.org/snacks).

I wanted a way to easily create a Snack from template without having to remember where and how.

## Usage

Write `snacks [title]` to create a Snack with that title and (current) date.

On the first run, it'll ask for the base folder.

# Snacks snippets for Raycast

On my website, I have a dev recipe section called [snacks](https://hamatti.org/snacks).

I wanted a way to easily create a Snack from template without having to remember where and how, directly from [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/).

It's not really directly helpful for anyone but me but I'm hoping that sharing it open source can help someone learn how to build what they need.

## Usage

Write `snacks [title]` to create a Snack with that title and (current) date.

On the first run, it'll ask for the base folder.
